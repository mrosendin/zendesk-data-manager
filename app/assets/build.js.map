Whether you need to find, export, import, or remove data, the Data Manager app makes it simple and easy. This application uses the Zendesk API to retrieve search results, import, and remove data, and a backend server generates the file export.</p>\n    <p>Groups, Organizations, Tickets, and Users are resources that utilize the <a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217385687-Zendesk-Support-advanced-search\" target=\"blank\">Advanced Search</a> engine. Advanced Search allows agents to construct complex search queries, but this application handles this complexity for you by dynamically constructing the search query as you enter information into the search filters. Automations, Macros, Triggers, and Views use a more simpler (and less powerful) Support metadata search engine that allows search by title only. Articles use the Guide search engine, which allows more flexibility than the Support metadata search engine but less options than Advanced Search.</p>\n    <h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n    <p>There are variations in features between all resources due to the nature of the Zendesk API. Below is a basic feature list broken down by navigation item:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Articles</strong></li>\n      <p>Articles utilize the Guide search engine which allows search for articles by keyword, category, section, labels, locale, and date created/updated ranges. Deleted articles are archived and can be restored in the Guide user interface (<a href=\"https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/235721587\" target=\"blank\">here for more info</a>). There is no bulk delete articles endpoint, so each article deletion will result in 1 API call. Export functionality enabled.</p>\n      <li><strong>Automations</strong></li>\n      <p>Automations utilize the Support metadata search engine which allows search by title and filtering by active/inactive automations. You can also sort automations by alphabetical, date created, date updated, or position order. Results can be ordered either ascending or descending.
